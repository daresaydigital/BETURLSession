> Using NSURLSession and the rest of the new iOS 7 foundation network classes, wrapped with syntactic sugar and convenience. No need to inherit and make a singleton. The category will keep track of your session with a user defined key. 

##Overview

A incredibly light weight and source-readable HTTP client. 
Plugginable Serializers on top of builting foundation classes NSURLSession and NSURLSessionTask.
Life-cycle callbacks (think before_filter or after_filter) 
Upload & Download progress blocks. 
Choose delegates and/or blocks
Convenience serializers (JSON out of the box by default) to get started fast. 



##Installation

```ruby
pod 'SIHTTPCore'
```


##Setup

```objective-c
#import <SIHTTPCore.h>
```


## API

This is currently a very early alpha version, 
look at ```NSURLSessionTask+SIHTTPCore.h``` & ```NSURLSession+SIHTTPCore.h``` to figure out how to use it. 
API changes are expected.

FAQ

>Q: Why are you making a category on NSObject.

A: Because the way NSURLSession and NSURLSessionDataTasks are made. NSURLSession and NSURLSessionDataTask has a method_missing dispatching all selectors to private classes - the _NSCF composite class.



>Q: Won't this pollute the public interface of basically everything?

A: Not really, only the implementation is on top of NSObject, the public interface is on the proper classes themselves


>Q: Why make Yet Another HTTP Client?

A: We needed a lightweight dependency for a different project. 
This is nothing but plugginable custom serializers for request & response with categories on top Apple's own classes. 
It gives you the option to use blocks and/or delegates and stays out of your way. 
It doesn't do too much. 
It has a very light and readable source code since it relies on NSURLSession. 



>Q: Where are the tests?

A: They'be comin'. Seriously though, I've been waiting on Travis to get fixed first.
